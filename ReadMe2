## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Airbnb listings in New York to uncover trends and patterns in rental data. The analysis utilizes Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for data wrangling and visualization.

## 🎯 Objective
The main goals of this project are:
1. Analyze **room types**, **prices**, and **availability** across New York neighborhoods.
2. Understand **host behavior** and listing patterns.
3. Detect and visualize potential **outliers** in pricing.
4. Provide **recommendations** for both guests and hosts based on data insights.

## 🧹 Workflow & Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in `price`, `neighborhood`, and `beds`.
- Converted `last_review` to datetime format.
- Capped listings with prices over $1,000 to reduce skewness.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Room Type Distribution**:  
  - Bar plots show **Entire home/apt** is the most common.
  
- **Neighborhood Insights**:  
  - Manhattan has the **highest average price**, followed by Brooklyn.

- **Availability Trends**:  
  - Heatmaps reveal relationships between `availability_365`, `price`, `reviews`, and `beds`.

- **Price Distribution**:  
  - Most listings are priced between **$50 and $300**.

- **Host Listings**:  
  - Boxplots identify hosts managing multiple properties.

- **Review Behavior**:  
  - Pairplots show trends between reviews, price, and availability.

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization Tools
- 📈 **Histograms, Boxplots** – Price distribution & outliers  
- 📊 **Bar Charts** – Room and neighborhood types  
- 🔥 **Heatmaps** – Feature correlations  
- 🔗 **Pairplots** – Relationship between reviews, price, and availability
